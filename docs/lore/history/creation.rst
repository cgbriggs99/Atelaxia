Creation of Atelaxia
====================

Story of Creation
-----------------
In the beginning, the world was a field of flowers. But it was very lonely. So the god Tela decided to make company for himself. First he started with the plants. He blessed several flowers, and they grew large and hard. Some began to bear fruit. Others stayed short and became tangled shrubs. This, he thought would be enough. But the sound of the wind blowing through the trees can only satisfy for so long, so Tela set to create creatures that could move and make their own sounds. So he created the creatures of the land. As the days bore on, these animals grew thirsty, so with parched throats they pleaded Tela for water. So Tela created vast oceans, rivers that spring from deep below the ground, and various bodies of water that grew in the low lands. The animals were satisfied at this offering. But only for so long could this company satisfy Tela. So Tela set out to create his masterpiece: creatures whose intellect could rival his own, who he could teach and converse with.

Tela set about creating all the species of the humanoids. To these groups, he gave his home and his creations. He gave the trees of the land for building. He gave the fruits and animals for nourishment. He gave the precious stones of the ground for making adornments and icons. He taught skills of language, art, thought, and community, which few others could possess. And for millennia Tela was content with all he created.

Betrayal of Tela
----------------

Once there was a human named Dhothbak, whose heart was pale as alabaster. He made it his goal to overthrow Tela as the ruler of the land. He taught his evil ways to all who would hear. His disciples would go out and cause chaos in the lands. After gaining thousands of followers, Dhothbak came to Tela. He spoke lies and deceit to gain Tela's trust. Years went by, and Tela came to know Dhothbak as a friend.

One day after many years, and gaining many more followers, Dhothbak set his plan into action. He developed a poison that he would give to Tela through his meal. When Tela realized this, he accosted Dhothbak, saying "what is this trickery? Why have you tried to poison my food?" Hearing this, Dhothbak attacked Tela. The two fought for many hours, and Dhothbak's followers engaged. Tela was evenly matched in his weakened state with Dhothbak and his army. So Tela cast a spell on Dhothbak and his followers. They all flew up into the sky. Every night, Dhothbak shows his face, and his followers appear in his ranks. But Tela comes to chase them away in the mornings.
