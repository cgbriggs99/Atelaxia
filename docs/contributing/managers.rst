Repository Managers
===================

As one of the original creators of this project, I am very familiar with my fellow original creators. As a result, I know the bickering that will happen as we work on this project. Therefore, I would like to add a clause here to prevent this. If bickering between co-creators gets to be too much, a neutral party may circumvent these and cement a decision. This may be a compromise that neither of the bickerers would be willing to come to. This may also be something completely different. If it is unpopular enough, it may be vetoed. If this happens, the feuding parties must agree to come to a compromise.
